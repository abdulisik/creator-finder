# Milestones and User Stories

## Milestone 1: Manual Entry and Basic Search (Self-Testing Stage)

User Story: As a user, I want to manually input the creators I follow to start building my profile.

User Story: As a user, I want to search for creators in the database to check if they are on Patreon.

Goal: Create a basic user interface to manually enter creator names and a simple search feature. This milestone allows for personal testing to validate the core functionality.

## Milestone 2: Database and Link Collection Expansion

User Story: As a user, I want the system to cross-reference multiple platforms for creators I follow, ensuring accurate tracking across YouTube, Patreon, and future platforms.

Goal: Expand the database to include more creators and cross-reference manually collected links between YouTube and Patreon. Improve the database schema for additional platforms.

## Milestone 3: API Integration (Friends-Testing Stage)

User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to automatically import the creators I follow on YouTube.
2. As a user, I want to see which of my followed YouTube creators have Patreon pages linked.

Goal: Integrate the YouTube API to automatically import creators, enabling initial feedback testing with friends.

### Milestone 3.1: Initial YouTube API Integration for Video Descriptions

Connect to the YouTube API to gather video descriptions from user-specified channels and extract any URLs.

### Milestone 3.2: Automated Link Insertion

Implement a method to automatically handle link insertion, classifying URLs by domain and platform.

### Milestone 3.3: OAuth Integration with YouTube for Subscribed Channels

Integrate YouTube OAuth to retrieve a userâ€™s subscriptions, extracting details to auto-populate creator profiles.

## Milestone 4: Basic User Management (Cookie-Based Subscriptions)

User Story: As a user, I want to save the list of creators I follow and search for links from those creators.

Objective: Introduce lightweight user management by using cookies to store each user's subscribed creators. This approach allows users to maintain a personalized experience without requiring formal account creation.

## Milestone 5: Basic UI Improvements

User Story: What is this app anyway?

### 5.1 Navigation Bar Enhancement

Polish the UI elements to enhance user experience.
