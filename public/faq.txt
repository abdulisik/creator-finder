FAQ

This tool helps you organize and discover public data about creators, such as links found in their video descriptions or profiles, across different platforms.

2. What data is stored on the server?

We only store public data (e.g., video descriptions and profile links). Subscription preferences are stored locally in your browser.

3. How is my data protected?

We don’t store personal data on our servers. Your subscription data and API authorization tokens are stored locally in your browser.

4. What happens when I authorize with YouTube?

Authorization allows us to fetch your subscriptions and import public data about those creators. This process is optional and entirely local; no personal tokens or subscription data are sent to our servers.
